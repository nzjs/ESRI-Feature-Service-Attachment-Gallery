# ESRI Feature Service Attachment Gallery

## What is it?
This tool takes an input ESRI hosted Feature Service URL and a theme parameter, and generates a new public URL for viewing the Feature Service attachments in a nice, responsive gallery. The intent is for the gallery URL to then be used as "Embedded Content" in an Operations Dashboard. 

Tested and working for both Survey123 features and QuickCapture feature attachments. In theory, it should work for any hosted layer with attachments enabled.

It works for both public and privately shared data, by generating a token for the gallery each time the page is refreshed.

## Requirements
- Files hosted on your own web server with PHP enabled
- Customise the main.php file with the below variables as desired
- Input Service URL matches a format similar to the one below, with layer number (eg. 0): 

  https://services3.arcgis.com/{ORG ID}/ArcGIS/rest/services/{SERVICE NAME}/FeatureServer/0

## Customisation
```php
// The AGOL user must have access to the feature layer(s) that you are generating a gallery for.
// This will generate a new token each time the Gallery page is refreshed (as tokens don't last forever).
// Generally speaking the tokenReferrer and tokenFormat should be left as the defaults below.
$agolUsername = '<ARCGIS ONLINE USERNAME>';
$agolPassword = '<ARCGIS ONLINE PASSWORD>';

$tokenReferrer = 'https://www.arcgis.com';
$tokenFormat   = 'pjson';

// Only show the latest ($maxImages) number of attachments in the Gallery page.
// Set to 0 (zero) if you want to return all attachments (not recommended).
$maxImages = 80;

// Here we also allow customisation of the dark/light themes.
// By default, we're using the ArcGIS Ops Dashboard CSS colours.
$darkThemeBack = '#222222';
$darkThemeFont = '#bdbdbd';

$lightThemeBack = '#ffffff';
$lightThemeFont = '#4c4c4c';
```

## How to use
1. Input your parameters on the initial page
- Feature Service URL
- Primary key identifier for layer (OBJECTID or FID?)
- Theme selection for gallery
2. View your gallery, then copy the custom gallery URL with GET parameters
(something like: https://{host}/attachments/gallery.php?id={base64 encoded ID}&theme=dark)
3. Paste the generated gallery URL into Operations Dashboard - Embedded Content panel
